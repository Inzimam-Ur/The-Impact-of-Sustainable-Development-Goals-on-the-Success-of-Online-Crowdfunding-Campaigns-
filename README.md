## 📘 Thesis Overview  
This repository hosts the **final master’s thesis project** conducted as part of the **Financial Economics program** at Ibn Haldun University (IHU).  

The research explores how **crowdfunding platforms**, as a form of **Financial Technology (FinTech)**, contribute to the achievement of the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.  

It investigates how **SDG-aligned campaigns** perform in terms of funding success, backer engagement, and sustainability impact using **Kickstarter dataset analysis**.

## 🧠 Research Objectives  
1. Examine how FinTech-based crowdfunding supports **sustainable development**.  
2. Evaluate the relationship between **SDG alignment** and **campaign success**.  
3. Identify which project characteristics (goal, duration, media, creator experience) influence success.  
4. Contribute to the academic dialogue between **financial innovation** and **sustainability goals**.
